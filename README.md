# Command Block Language

## Gamepedia
Before we jump right into this, at the [minecraft gamepedia](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block) there is a site that would be wise to know.

## What Is A Command Block?
A command block is a block that you can insert a special code that mojang created. A command block can be powered by redstone, which can be useful in minigames or servers. Although a command block doesn't have a limit of characters, chat has a limit of 100 characters.

## The Different Types Of Command Blocks
There are 3 types of command blocks and each one has it's own property. Here they Are:
-Impulse command blocks are the default, and the only ones in 1.8. They simply execute the command once, and nothing else.
-Chain command blocks act as a chain. (Hence it's name). The arrow points in the direction that the redstone source will come out of, so make sure that's where you put your next command block.
